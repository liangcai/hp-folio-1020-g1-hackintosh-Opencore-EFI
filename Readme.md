I've been using it for about 6 months and it's basically equivalent to a mac mini 2014 with screen

## os version
monterey

## Compatibility
The following features work but have a few problems
- hdmi output
- touchpad && touch screen
- bluetooth(May need to restart bluetooth service after waking from sleep)

## Hardware
cpu: 5y71
memory:8gb
screen: 2k touch screen
ssd: 180gb intel ssd

## Bios
I forgot about the Bios settings, I don't have the computer anymore, just turn off the security settings.
